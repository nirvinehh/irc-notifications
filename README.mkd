# IRC Notifications

Inspired by seeing a blog post about Net::AppNotifications many moons ago I
set about getting alerts for irssi on my iPhone.

This evolved, broke and adapted over the years.

Now I've no longer got an iPhone, the work firewall and proxy ahve changed and
I'm on a MacBook instead of an Ubuntu PC.

Something are more portable than others...
